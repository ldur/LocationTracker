help me develop my ios app by suggesting changes to my sourcecode in a file by file dialog so i can easily copy the modified files into my xcode project. I want you to write out the complete source file (Swift) one by one and explain to me what the best approach is to update my Xcode project and present it as an artifact in the right pane of this dialog.
